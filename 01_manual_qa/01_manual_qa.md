# What is software testing?
**Software testing** is a process of analyzing software and accompaning documentation in order to identify defects and improve the quality of the product.

**Software testing** is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software prodcut of application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.


## What is software quality
Quality software is reasonably bug or defect free, delivered on time and within budget, meets requirements and/or expectations, and is maintainable.
Key aspects of quality for the customer iclude:

- ***Good design*** - looks and style. The application or product should meet all the requirement specifications and at the same time it should be user friendly. 
- ***Good functinality*** - it does the job well. All the features and their functiobality should work as expected. There should not be any deviation in the actual result and the expected result.
- ***Reliable*** - acceptable level of breakdowns and failure. For example: There is and app of saving the students records. This app should save all the students records and should not fail after entering 100 records.
- ***Consistency.*** Single software can be multi dimensional. It is very important that all different dimensions should behave in a consistent manner.
- ***Durable - lasts as long as it should.*** For example: if software is being used for a year and the number of data has exceed 5000 records then it should not fail if number of records increased. The app should continue to behave in the same way without any functional breaks.
- ***Good after sales service.*** Once the product is shipped to the customer then maintenance comes into the picture. It is very important to provide good sales services to keep the customer happy and satisfied.
- ***Vaue for money.*** Itâ€™s always important to deliver the product to the customers which have value for money.


## Verification and Validation
***Verification*** is a process of datermining if the software is designed and developed as per the specified requirements.
***Validation*** is the process of checking if the software (end product) has met the client's true needs and expectations.


## Testing Goals
The main goal of software testing is to find bugs as early as possible. The goals of software testing may be classified into three major categories as follows:
- Finding defects which may get created by the programmer while defeloping the SW.
- Gaining confidence in and providing information about the level of quality.
- To prevent defects.
- To make sure that the end result meets the business and user requirements.
- To ensure that it satisfies the Business Requirement Specification and System Requirement Specification.
- To gain the confidence of the customers by providing them with a quality product.
