# Testing Principles

## \#1. Testing shows presence of defects
While doing testing, we can only identify that application or software has any errors. By doing testing on any application, we can decrease the number of bugs, which does not mean that the application is defect-free because sometimes the software seems to be bug-free while performing multiple types of testing on it. But at the time of deployment in the production server, if the end-user encounters those bugs which are not found in the testing process.

## \#2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
Exhaustive testing is impossible means the SW can never test at every TC. It can test only some TCs and assume that the SW is correct and it will produce the correct output in every tet case.

## \#3. Early testing
The defect detected in the early phases of SDLC will be very less expensive. For better performance of software, software testing will start at the initial phase i.e. testing will perform at the requirement analysis phase.

## \#4. Defects clustering
In a project, a small number of modules can contain most of the defects. Pareto Principle to SW states that 80% of defects comes from 20% of modules.

## \#5. Pesticide paradox
Repeating the same TCs, again and again, will not find new bugs. So it is necessary to review the TCs and add or update TCs to find new bugs.

## \#6. Testing is context depending
The testing approach depends on the context of the SW developed. Different types of SW need to perform different types of testing. For example, the testing of the e-commerce site is different from the testing of the Android application.

## \#7. Absence-of-errors fallacy
If a built SW is 99% bug-free but it does not follow the user requirement then it is unusable. It is not only necessary that software is 99% bug-free but it is also mandatory to fulfill all the customer requirements.
